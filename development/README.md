# Nuker Bot - dev section
**If you're not after a pre-release, please head to the [main branch](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/Nuker-Bot/tree/main)!**

## Latest Pre-Release Version: N/A
### This section contains the pre-release versions; some features may be unstable or not work at all!
**Last STABLE version: v1.4**

**Here are the pre-release which is created when enough of the planned features are stable. It is available but I don't recommend you do unless you're feeling a little risky since many features can be unstable or broken.**

> Note: **alpha** versions are pre-releases that have just got new features that may be broken but no bug-testing and **beta** versions are pre-releases that have working features with a little bug testing.

**Some features in these versions may never even be officially released and pre-release versions would be the only way to get them.**
**You may find requests and fixes from pull requests, issues, etc. in these versions.**
**All pre-release version will be officially released on the releases page but only Python files will be available.**
